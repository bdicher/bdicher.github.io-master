						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>Bogdan is a philosopher and logician who, for the purposes of this website, acquired the disturbing habit of speaking of himself in the third person.</p>
							<p><s>Currently, Bogdan is a postdoc at the <a href="http://unica.it">University of Cagliari</a>, where he works in the <a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/">ALOPHIS</a> research group.</s>
<p>Bogdan moved! As of Septmeber 2918, he's (still a humble) postdoc on the by the Atlantic. More precisely, at the <a href="http://cful.letras.ulisboa.pt">Centre for Philosophy</a> of the <a href="http://www.ulisboa.pt">University of Lisbon</a>.</p>
								 &#151 He got his PhD from the <a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au">University of Melbourne</a> with a thesis on logical pluralism written under the supervision of <a href="http://consequently.org">Greg Restall</a>.</p>
 							<p>This is still true: What the future will bring, no one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBBeTHrG6Cs">knows</a>. &#151 </p>
							<p>Bogdan is also on <a href="https://twitter.com/bdicher">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bdicher/">instagram</a></span>. Bogdan blogs <a href="http://bdicher.me//post">here</a>.</p>

									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p><b>When:</b> 2016</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Mind</i> (125(499):727-757; doi:10.1093/mind/fzv214)</p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: In this paper I offer a proof-theoretic defence of meaning-invariant logical pluralism. I argue that there is a relation of co-determination between the operational and structural aspects of a logic. As a result, some features of the consequence relation are induced by the connectives. I propose that a connective is defined by those rules which are conservative and unique, while at the same time expressing only connective-induced structural information. This is the key to stabilizing the meaning of the connectives across multiple determinations of the consequence relation.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Weak disharmony: some lessons for proof-theoretic semantics</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p><b>When:</b> 2016</p>
										<p><b>Where:</b> <i>The Review of Symbolic Logic</i> (9(3):583-602; doi:10.1017/S1755020316000162)</p>
										<p><b>What about</b>: A logical constant is weakly disharmonious if its elimination rules are weaker than its introduction rules. Substructural weak disharmony is the weak disharmony generated by structural restrictions on the eliminations. I argue that substructural weak disharmony is not a defect of the constants which exhibit it. To the extent that it is problematic, it calls into question the structural properties of the derivability relation. This prompts us to rethink the issue of controlling the structural properties of a logic by means of harmony. I argue that such a control is possible and desirable. Moreover, it is best achieved by global tests of harmony.</p>

																		<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">ST, LP, and tolerant metainferences (with Francesco Paoli) [draft available]</h4>
																		<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
																			<p>Draft available <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kmw0v47qoco6vpn/ST%2C%20LP%20and%20tolerant%20metainferences_final.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
									<p>The strict-tolerant (ST) approach to paradox promises to erect theories
									of naïve truth and tolerant vagueness on the safe bedrock of classical logic.
									We assess the extent to which this claim is founded. Building on some
									results by Girard [11], we show that the usual proof-theoretic formulation
									of propositional ST in terms of the classical sequent calculus without
									primitive Cut is incomplete with respect to ST-valid metainferences, and
									exhibit a complete calculus for the same class of metainferences. We also
									argue that the latter calculus, far from coinciding with classical logic, is a
									close kin of Priest’s LP.</p>

																		<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">On a generality condition in proof-theoretic semantics</h4>
																		<p><b>When:</b> 2017</p>
																		<p><b>Where:</b> <i>Theoria</p>
																		<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
																		<p>Recently, Nissim Francez defended a generality condition on defining rules in proof-theoretic semantics, according to which the schematic formulation of the defining rules must be maximally general. (See his wonderful book, <i>Proof-theoretic semantics</i>.) Context variables must always be present in the schematic rules and they should range over arbitrary collections of formulae. Moreover, no restrictions must be placed on the contexts of these rules. I argue against imposing such a condition.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Hopeful monsters: A note on multiple conclusions</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Arguments are usually understood as having one or more premises and only one conclusion. However, this notion of argument can be generalised and we may let arguments have not one, but several disjunctively connected conclusions. This is a contentious generalisation. In this paper I will argue that it is, nonetheless, justified. I argue that multiple conclusions are epiphenomena of the logical connectives. That is, I argue that some connectives induces multiple-conclusion derivations. In this sense, such derivations are completely natural. Moreover, I argue that they can safely be used in the proof-theoretic semantics.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">A defence of Belnapian harmony</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
										<p>Dummett identified harmony with conservativeness, which, as you recall, was half of Belnap's solution to tonk. The other half is uniqueness. Conservativeness is tricky. It is a global property of proof systems and it seems wrong to take it as the formal mark of a local property of introduction-elimination rules. In this paper I argue that this shouldn't be a worry. Indeed, Belnap's dual criterion of definitional success is the best formal expression of harmony.</p>

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">That paper on Finnis on gay marriage that still needs a title</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
						<p>Reshaping the ideas of a plump Italian monk from the Middle Ages into the basis of sexual morality in the 21st century is a stroke of genius. Of course, it doesn't work. In this paper I try to show that it doesn't work in the particular case of gay marriage. Now, this has been done quite a number of times. (It looks easy enough, right?) Well, here I'm trying to put myself into Finnis' shoes and show that it doesn't work by his own lights. Lights out (not literally!) and get on to it, however you like it! We need link, don't we?

									<h4 class="cbp-nttrigger">Meaning, rules, and proofs</h4>
									<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p>This year Bogdan is teaching a doctoral course on proof-theoretic semantics and some other stuff. It's fun. He has one formal student, so he feels a bit like Frege. Fortunately, there's no reason for him to feel like Violetta (you know, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyAKnC5cl4I">solo, abbandonato in questo popoloso deserto</a> and so on and so forth). That's because he has a wider audience consisting of other students, colleagues, and supra-colleagues (i.e., the boss, <a href="http://people.unica.it/alophis/members/paoli-francesco/">Francesco Paoli</a>).

						<div class="cbp-ntcontent">
							<p><b>The short version</b> is</b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6y0IROfgJbo">here</a>.</p>
							<p><b>The technical aspects.</b> This site is made with <a href="http://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> - so Bogdan <i>borrowed</i> <a href="http://rohan-french.github.io/">Rohan's</a> idea of stealing <a href="http://consequently.org">consequently's</a> idea. Using Hugo was quite unnecessary: Bogdan soon realised that he needs to write a theme. For that, he'd have had to understand the syntax of Go. But his procrastination needs are nowhere near so complex. So, he went over to <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/">codrops</a>, lawfully appropriated <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/03/29/nested-accordion/">this template</a>, and cheerfully (and mercilessly) hacked the css and html provided. By <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7trldSOwvoA">Paris</a>, you should enjoy the result: the colour scheme of the previous live version was inspired by the rainbow lorikeet.</p>
							<p><b>The grand perspective.</b> It's grand but simple and elaborated by <a href="http://john.jperry.net/">John Perry</a>. Bogdan had bucketloads of work to do, so he decided to revive his website.</p>
